Notes: 

1. This is an android app used to evaluate different gestures that can be performed to google search a selected text on an android device.

2. The source code can be directly imported as an eclipse project. 

3. The app tracks the user's gestures using a technique called SVG polyline which traces the points of the gesture performed and helps in recreating those gesturs in a javascript environment.
